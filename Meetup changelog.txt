Installed Datatables! Got it all working with Bootstrap after having to rearrange the order of the 'reguires' statements in application.js 
Realized that he's only using a Buy It Now button with no way to add additiona products into the cart. Ridiculous. Gonna look at the Agile Wb Apps book and see if I can cobble that together.

had to back out simple form and all _form styling. couldn't upload images...now i can but I'm getting an error.
WOO HOO! 2 days later I got it working! Had to complie ImageMagick to do it. From johncox00 @ https://github.com/thoughtbot/paperclip/issues/1205

8/28
Changed routes back to 4.1 syntax - then back to Hartl's. Both work now. Experimented with 'as:' syntax but about_url broke the link.
Changed link_to to use "*_path"
Installed Bootstrap gem (Lesson 3)
Tried to get the NavBar working but it's only using 1/3 of the screen....

8/27 
Changed application layout to use link_to instead of hard coding about/contact page hrefs
Changed default order of routes and syntax to match Hartl's so new link_to's would work 
	(sometimes after a few clicks it would freak out)
